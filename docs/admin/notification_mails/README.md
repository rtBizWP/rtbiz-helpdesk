# Notification Mails

Notification mails are sent by Helpdesk system to stakeholders in the Helpdesk system. These mails are sent for events (Refer 2.4).

Each entry in the matrix below suggests whether a mail is sent to an entity (column) on an action (row).

**Note:** This is the default notification behaviour that Helpdesk follows. Settings to manage notifications will be rolled out with the future versions.
