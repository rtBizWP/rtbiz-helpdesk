# Ticket Status

There are three status for a ticket that the current version of Helpdesk supports:

1. **Unanswered** - This status represents that a ticket has not been replied by staff. This can be a new ticket or a ticket without a staff reply.

2. **Answered** - Represents that a ticket has been answered by staff.

3. **Solved** - Represents that a ticket has been resolved by staff.

Note: The new versions of helpdesk will have provision to create custom status.
